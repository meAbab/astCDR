# astCDR

This one is a try of customize and modify Asterisk CDR viewer. 
The main project is here - https://code.google.com/p/asterisk-cdr-viewer/

I've added a table contains user/pass and add login option with it.

Idea of login code is taken from http://www.formget.com/login-form-in-php/

I'd done few more things before, like calculating rates and others little different way than original one. 

But need to find those work in my laptops / PCs.
